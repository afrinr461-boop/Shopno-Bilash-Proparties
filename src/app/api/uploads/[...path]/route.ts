 * Serves files written via `saveUploadedFile` when the active store is
 * Netlify Blobs (see `lib/uploadStore.ts`) — a Blob has no filesystem path
 * of its own for Next's static `public/` handler to serve, so this route
 * is the substitute. Local-disk uploads never hit this route: they keep
 * their old `/uploads/...` URL, served statically as always. Publicly
 * reachable with no auth check, same as every file under `public/uploads/`
 * already was before this route existed — not a security change, just a
 * like-for-like replacement of how the bytes get to the browser.
