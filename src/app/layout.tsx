        `overflow-x-hidden` here is a deliberate safety net, not a fix for
        one specific element: decorative "bleed" motifs (e.g. Values.tsx's
        two side graphics, positioned outside their narrow container into
        the page gutter) can overflow the viewport at some breakpoints
        depending on exact gutter width, which showed up as a real
        horizontal scrollbar and made scrolling feel glitchy. The page
        itself should never scroll horizontally — DESIGN_SYSTEM.md already
        says wide content belongs in its own `overflow-x-auto` container,
        never the page — this just enforces that at the root instead of
        chasing every current/future decorative element's exact math.
