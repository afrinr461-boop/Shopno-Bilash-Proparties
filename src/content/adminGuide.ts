          "COMPANY OVERVIEW — Total Projects: every project you can see, with the subtext splitting it into Active (status Ongoing or Ready) and Completed. Total Units: every unit across those projects, split into Assigned (has an owner) and Available. Total Owners: the number of distinct people/entities (customers, shareholders, landowners combined) who currently own something — an owner counted once even if they hold several units. Parking: total parking spaces, with how many are currently Assigned (anything not left as \"Available\").",

          "FINANCIAL OVERVIEW — Expected Collections: the total amount owners are expected to pay in total across every cost-allocation goal set up for their projects (adjustments/waivers already included). Collected: how much of that has actually been paid. Outstanding: Expected minus Collected — every contribution not yet fully paid, whether or not it's overdue yet. Overdue Amount: the stricter subset of Outstanding that's specifically past its due date — this is why Overdue is always ≤ Outstanding, never more. Project Expenses / Material Cost / Contractor Cost: real money spent, summed only from Expenses/Purchases/Contractor Payments marked verified or completed (a pending or rejected one never inflates these). Budget vs Actual compares the total planned Budget against this same real Actual figure — not the hand-typed \"Actual (Manual)\" field you may see on an individual Project Finance budget line, which can drift from this real number if it's never updated to match.",

          "CONSTRUCTION — Active Projects: projects currently Ongoing (Ready/Upcoming/Completed don't count here). Overall Progress: the average of every project's own overall construction progress %. Delayed Stages: phases past their target date that aren't marked completed or cancelled. Upcoming Milestones: due within the next 30 days. Overdue Tasks: the same \"past target date, not done\" rule, applied to individual tasks instead of whole phases.",

          "SALES — Active Leads: every lead not yet closed Won or Lost (mirrors the Sales Dashboard). Active Bookings: Reserved/Booked/Confirmed bookings only. Completed Sales: finalized, non-cancelled transactions. Pending Sales: sales still Pending or Confirmed. Available Units: unsold units with Available status — this exact same number also appears under Company Overview, folded into Total Units' \"assigned · available\" subtext, so don't expect it to look like a separate new figure. Sales Value: total price of every non-cancelled sale.",

          "INVENTORY — Low Stock / Out of Stock: current stock compared against each material's own threshold (or the company-wide default in Settings → Regional & Defaults if that material has none set). Recent Purchases / Recent Usage: both scoped to just the last 7 days — a purchase/usage from 8+ days ago won't show here even though it's still in the full Procurement records.",

          "DOCUMENTS & ALERTS — Total Documents: every document on file, regardless of status. Expiring Soon / Expired: driven by each document's own expiry date. Critical/High/Medium/Low: the same underlying alerts feeding the \"Urgent\" banner at the very top of this page, just totalled by severity — Critical+High here should always match what \"Urgent\" is drawing from.",
